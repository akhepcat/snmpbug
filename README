This code is just a modified version of the mini-snmpd code found at
https://github.com/troglobit/mini-snmpd.git

all chages were made to eliminate user-facing variables that are mib-centric.

This  'snmpbug'  version simply logs the -v1 and -v2c  community-string to stdout
as well as the IPv4/IPv6 address.

It also fixes the 'drop privs' function to correctly set the gid based on the provided users's default group id; not by name

It's the 'canary-in-the-coalmine'  for snmp attacks.

TODO:
	* keep stripping out unused code
	** no need for system monitoring
	** no need for MIB parsing/updating/etc
	** simplify, simplify, simplify!
