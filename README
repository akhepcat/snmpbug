This code is just a modified version of the mini-snmpd code found at
https://github.com/troglobit/mini-snmpd.git

all chages were made to eliminate user-facing variables that are mib-centric.

It also fixes the 'drop privs' function to correctly set the gid based on the provided users's default group id; not by name

It's the 'canary-in-the-coalmine'  for snmp attacks.

Currently, 'snmpbug' simply logs the -v1 and -v2c  community-string to stdout, as well as the soure IPv4/IPv6 address.

Instead of returning data, it returns a "Resources unavailable" error.

TODO:
	* keep stripping out unused code
	** simplify, simplify, simplify!

DONE:
	* Return exactly one record of the type requested, with null data - instead of an error.
	** no need for system monitoring
	** no need for MIB parsing/updating/etc
